  Your focus determines your reality.

Hello all, so I am starting a brand new blog. I'll keep my posts short everytime so it'll take at most 5 minutes to read. For this post, I wanna talk about the importance of 'F.O.C.U.S'. I recently realized how much focus can change the life of a person. Back then, I was a much more focused person, I was always very determined and gave my best in everything that I did. But when 'catastrophe' hit, I lost my focus, I became very distracted and everything was just falling apart. I guess PhD was not an easy journey at all, but I would like to give my support to everyone that is going through a tough time now. Remember that "it will pass" and once it's over, you'll be on fire and ready to race again. One important advice that I can give is to talk to people when you feel down or when you don't feel like anyone could understand you, just write it down somewhere. That way, it really relieves a lot of pressure and you'll feel lighter and better afterwards.

But focusing on the wrong things might cause you trouble as well. I personally experienced that and reality hit me hard. While the process hasn't been easy, I came to a realization that I am much happier when I am focusing on things that don't bring me any harm or sadness. Even though it could get lonely at times (especially during these pandemic times when I don't really come into contact with anyone), I've been trying to overcome it myself instead of relying on others. I can't bear silence so I have to keep blasting out upbeat music all the time in my room and when I feel a bit sad or lonely, I'll just sing along and I'll miraculously feel better again. Also, I take breaks whenever I need it because that's important for me to not get burnt out. At least that's how I maintain my focus.

Lastly, I think it's important to be organized in order to stay focused, so I always try to plan my day before I start doing any work. There are so many things that I wanna do and I need to do, so I get overwhelmed easily sometimes. Planner is like my best friend and it has saved me a lot by listing out all the things that I need to do and rank them in terms of priority. In terms of my plans right now after passing my qualifying exam, I decided that I wanna focus on computer vision and so I am starting to read a lot on it. I am starting with adversarial attacks which I think is an important topic being discussed in the community right now. I hope I could do a little project on it and post it in my blog.

That's all I have to say for now. Stay focused folks! <3
