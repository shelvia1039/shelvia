  A roadmap to help machine learning beginners head towards the right direction.

Machine learning is a continuously developing field and it may seem daunting at first for someone with no background to get into the field. Even I struggle to keep up with the field and feel that I am missing or forgetting some concepts sometimes. Thankfully, some people have come up with a useful roadmap that summarizes what you need to know or learn in machine learning as well as how you can go about learning them. Having a mindmap by your side is useful as it helps you see the connections between different concepts and you could then start to piece things together on your own eventually. I think I would also be interested to create my own mindmap when I am more proficient later on.

## Daniel Bourke's Machine Learning Roadmap

**What the roadmap covers:**
- Machine learning problems
- Machine learning process
- Machine learning tools
- Machine learning mathematics
- Machine learning resources

The roadmap is continously being updated. For now, it heavily focuses on supervised learning, but might include other learning techniques such as unsupervised learning or self-supervised learning in the future.
