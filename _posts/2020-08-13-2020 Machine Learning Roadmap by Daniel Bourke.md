  A roadmap to help machine learning beginners head towards the right direction.

Machine learning is a continuously developing field and it may seem daunting at first for someone with no background to get into the field. Even I struggle to keep up with the field and feel that I am missing or forgetting some concepts sometimes. Thankfully, some people have come up with a useful roadmap that summarizes what you need to know or learn in machine learning as well as how you can go about learning them. Having a mindmap by your side is useful as it helps you see the connections between different concepts and you could then start to piece things together on your own eventually. I think I would also be interested to create my own mindmap when I am more proficient later on.
