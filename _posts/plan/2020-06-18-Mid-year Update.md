  When things didn't go as you planned, don't be let down. Make new plans. The sun doesn't stop shining just because of dark clouds.

Time flies and we are already marching into the second half of 2020. From the quote above, you probably could already tell that things didn't go as planned for me. Also, the COVID-19 incident just made it worse, but I hope everyone stays safe. Bad stuffs happened and that's life, which is fine because there are always blessings in disguise. Sometimes, bad events ought to happen in order for good things to come. So yes, I have taken a break for a while and it's necessary in order for me to recover. Now, I am slowly regaining my motivation and confidence, and hence this post is meant to serve as a reminder for that. In this post, I will briefly outline what my current focus is and what I hope to achieve by end of year.

## Research comes first, interests second
Alright, so I have to do my PhD Qualifying Exam (PQE) by December this year. Therefore, the main goal for the second half of the year is to produce enough results to be presented in my PQE. Failing this exam is not acceptable! My current focus is still the same which is to look at understanding deep neural networks from the chaos point of view. The topic itself is not easy at all, as it requires the knowledge from statistical physics (my weakest module in my undergraduate study) and chaos theory (a module I did not take during my undergraduate time). Therefore, it's time to pick up the necessary concepts and start doing the work. If I have any interesting results, I might be able to participate in the NeurIPS conference workshop to present those results. I've got limited time, and thus this has to come above anything else.

When I have some spare time during weekends perhaps, I would hope to re-learn the fundamentals of deep learning. I feel that I am familiar with the concepts but if I am asked to give a lecture on it, I am not yet that confident. I think it's because I have never really learnt it in a systematic way. Hence, I would like to take notes during my learning this time so that I could look back at it in the future when I need to. I will also probably take up more relevant courses on coursera or udemy because sometimes I get more motivated by following a course rather than just gathering resources on my own.

## Setting aside time for research papers
I think keeping up with research papers is still very important, but I might not be able to allocate much time for it as my research has to come first as mentioned above. Nevertheless, I would try to read at least a research paper a week, and I think that's good enough. I would post the summary on my Medium, as usual. Also, another way to stay informed of current research is to read articles on the Medium because other people would have already summarized the research papers for you. So that's what I could do daily (otherwise my paid membership on Medium would have gone to waste). One last thing I could think of is to just watch youtube videos where people present their ideas either on conferences or they could just be some lectures people give formally or informally. I personally feel that watching is a much enjoyable task compared to reading, perhaps because it feels like a less one-sided interaction when you could listen to people talking.

## New project - COVID-19
I wanted to say that COVID-19 isn't so bad, but that sounds really wrong. What I really meant is that at least it gives me something to work on. There is a bunch of COVID-19 datasets out there and lots of interesting projects related to it that I could possibly engage myself in. I have started working on COVID-19 CT dataset which I presented during my research group meeting. My schedule is a bit tight with my PQE drawing near, so I am not yet sure how much time I could set aside for this project. Nevertheless, I will definitely keep posting my ideas or results on this website to track my progress.

## Trying not to overwhelm myself
Okay, so I am the type of person who gets easily excited on new ideas or projects or plans. But the bad thing about this is that I tend to overwhelm myself with so many things that I want to do and in the end, I got burned out and got nothing close to being done. So this time, I will just focus on whatever I have written above and stick to them. What I could possibly do is to note down any interesting ideas and save them for next year. By end of the year, I hope to at least pass my PQE and master the fundamentals of deep learning while still being aware of the current research in the field. Whether or not I manage to do anything interesting with the COVID-19 datasets is secondary to all those. It would be a bonus if I could create something interesting out of it.

That's all for now. Stay safe everyone!
