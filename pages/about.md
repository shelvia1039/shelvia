Hello! Thank you for visiting my page. I am currently a PhD student in [NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering (NGS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg/ngs/) at National University of Singapore (NUS) under the supervision of Prof. [Mehul Motani](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/motani/) and Prof. [Lai Choy Heng](https://www.physics.nus.edu.sg/staff/laich.html).

I aspire to be a deep learning / artificial intelligence researcher after I graduate. Currently, I am interested in the science of deep learning i.e. theoretical understanding of why deep learning performs well. My research is very much interdisciplinary requiring knowledge from computer science, mathematics, physics, and information theory.

Prior to joining NUS as a PhD student, I was studying Physics at National Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I have been involved in research of particle physics at [CERN](https://home.cern/) as well as the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/academics/grad_science.html) during my undergraduate studies. For my Final Year Project (FYP), I had the honor of doing my research on proton therapy at [Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI)](https://www.psi.ch/en), Switzerland, which built the worldwide first compact scanning gantry for treating deep-seated tumours with proton beam.
