    Hi, my name is Shelvia or you can simply call me Shel.
    I mainly post about my plans as well as my PhD journey here.
    If you are interested, you can check out the list of projects I have done in my Github.
    I also summarize some research papers that I read, they are all over my Medium page.
    Feel free to e-mail me if you would like to reach out to me! All the links are provided below.
    I would love to chat and share about my experience as a PhD student pursuing deep learning research.
    Thanks for dropping by!
